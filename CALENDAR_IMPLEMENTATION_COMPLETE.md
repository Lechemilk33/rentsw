## Key Features in Detail

### 🔧 Maintenance Task Integration

```typescript
// Maintenance tasks automatically appear as calendar events
const maintenanceEvents = useMemo(() => {
  return maintenanceTasks.map(task => ({
    id: `maintenance-${task.id}`,
    title: `${task.vehicle_make} ${task.vehicle_model} - ${task.maintenance_type}`,
    description: `${task.work_performed} | Tech: ${task.technician}`,
    date: new Date(task.date),
    startTime: '09:00',
    type: 'maintenance',
    maintenanceId: task.id,
    isCompleted: task.status === 'completed'
  }))
}, [maintenanceTasks])
```

**Visual Differentiation:**
- Maintenance tasks: Yellow color scheme with wrench icon
- Custom events: Blue color scheme with calendar icon
- Completed tasks: Green checkmark indicator

### 📅 Calendar Views

**Monthly View:**
- Full month grid with previous/next navigation
- Today highlighting with blue accent
- Weekend subtle background differentiation
- Event indicators (up to 2 visible, "+X more" for overflow)
- Click any day to switch to detailed view

**Daily View:**
- Hourly time slots (30-minute increments)
- Event display with full details
- Click empty slots to create new events
- Back to month navigation

### ✨ Event Management

**Custom Event Creation:**
- Click any empty time slot or "Add Event" button
- Comprehensive form with optional fields:
  - Title (required)
  - Description
  - Start/End times
  - Category (Meeting, Inspection, Delivery, etc.)
- Drag and drop functionality for moving events
- Edit existing events by clicking
- Delete events with confirmation

### 🔗 Navigation Integration

**Maintenance Click Handler:**
```typescript
const handleMaintenanceTaskClick = (taskId: string) => {
  // Navigate to maintenance page with specific task highlighted
  navigate(`/operations?tab=maintenance&task=${taskId}`)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless workflow: Calendar → Maintenance page → specific task
- Context preservation with URL parameters
- Deep linking support for bookmarking specific tasks

## UI/UX Design Principles

### 🎨 Design System Compliance

**Consistent Styling:**
- Uses existing Button and Card components
- Follows RENTAGAIN color scheme (blue primary, yellow maintenance)
- Phosphor React icons throughout
- Same hover states and transitions as other components

**Professional Headers:**
- Standard component headers (NOT the special ContactBookOverlay blue gradient)
- Consistent typography and spacing patterns
- Same button styles and focus management
- Proper semantic HTML structure

### ♿ Accessibility Features

**Full Compliance:**
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Focus management between calendar views
- High contrast mode support
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

**Interactive Elements:**
- All buttons have proper focus states
- Form labels correctly associated with controls
- Clear visual hierarchy and readable text
- Touch-friendly buttons for mobile

## Performance Optimizations

### ⚡ Efficient Rendering

**React Optimizations:**
- `useMemo` for expensive calculations (event filtering, calendar generation)
- Proper key props for list rendering (no array indices)
- Minimal re-renders with targeted state updates
- Lazy loading for different month views

**Calendar Generation:**
- Efficient date calculations
- Smart event filtering by date
- Optimized grid rendering
- Smooth animations without performance impact

### 🔄 Data Management

**State Structure:**
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  date: Date
  startTime?: string
  endTime?: string
  type: 'maintenance' | 'custom' | 'booking'
  category?: string
  maintenanceId?: string
  isCompleted?: boolean
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Maintenance tasks converted to calendar events
- Custom events stored in component state
- Future: Supabase integration for event persistence
- Real-time updates when maintenance data changes

## Future Enhancements Ready

### 🚀 Supabase Integration Ready

The calendar is designed to easily integrate with Supabase when ready:

```typescript
// Future Supabase integration point
const { data: maintenance, error } = await supabase
  .from('maintenance_entries')
  .select('*')
  .eq('location_id', userLocationId)
  .order('date', { ascending: true })
```

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

**Adaptive Layouts:**
- Mobile: Single column with collapsible calendar
- Tablet: 2-column layout
- Desktop: 3-column layout as implemented
- Touch-friendly interactions throughout

### 🔔 Notification System Ready

**Placeholder for:**
- Event reminders
- Maintenance task alerts
- Schedule conflict warnings
- Mobile push notifications
